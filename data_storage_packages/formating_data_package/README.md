# Formating data package 
## Files 
- `./storage_format_class.py :`class for dumping and loading data and making an instance from it with any format 
- `./json_data.py :` JSOn data format Example
- `./xml_data.py :` Mock for XML data format 

## Python object serialization
### We can use 2 Ways For Doing that 
- Pickle : it takes the format whatever it's type and converting it to bytes so we can recover anytime from this file using python 
- Making our class for dump and load : so it's looking like we are creating the pickle from scratch (I used this )
